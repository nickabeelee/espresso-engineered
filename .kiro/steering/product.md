# Product Overview

Espresso Engineered is a community-driven espresso brewing companion focused on **recording brews**, **learning from shared data**, and **surfacing practical grind and recipe suggestions** based on real-world usage.

## Core User Concept
Users are called **Baristas** who:
- Log espresso brews using beans, grinder, and machine
- Publish brews publicly by default
- Learn by browsing and comparing brews from others
- Contribute implicitly to communal suggestions

## MVP Goals
1. People want to record espresso brews quickly and cleanly
2. Shared brew data is more valuable than isolated notes
3. Community-driven suggestions (grind, recipe) are useful even before advanced ML

## Key Principles
- Minimize required input during the brewing moment
- Reuse prior context aggressively
- Surface intelligent suggestions at the right time
- Allow reflection to happen later
- Keep all interactions fast and forgiving

## V1 Scope
- Authentication & Identity (Supabase-based)
- Brew Logging (offline-capable drafts)
- Brew Visibility & Interaction (public by default)
- Community Suggestions (rules-based, not ML)
- Admin Capabilities

## Explicitly Out of Scope for V1
- Push notifications
- Advanced personalization or ML
- Private brews or messaging
- Monetization
- Multi-language support
